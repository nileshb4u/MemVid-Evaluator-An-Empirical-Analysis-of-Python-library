# MemVid-Evaluator-An-Empirical-Analysis-of-Python-library


This project provides a framework and tools to empirically evaluate the **MemVid** library (version 0.2.x), particularly its core functionalities for encoding textual data into a video format (reportedly using QR codes) and subsequently retrieving that text.

## üìå Evaluation Focus

- **Storage Efficiency**: Comparing MemVid's storage footprint against original and compressed text.
- **Processing Speed**: Measuring encoding and decoding times.
- **Data Transformation & Fidelity**: Understanding how MemVid processes input text and the accuracy of retrieval.

The MemVid library itself (v0.2.x) is a comprehensive AI memory system, but this evaluator primarily focuses on foundational text-to-video encoding and retrieval aspects (`MemvidEncoder` and `MemvidRetriever`).

## üöÄ Features of This Evaluator

- **Automated Benchmarking**: `run_all_experiments.py` tests multiple files and parameter configurations.
- **Interactive Application**: Streamlit-based app for file upload, parameter selection, benchmarking, and result viewing.
- **Results Dashboard**: Visualize and filter benchmark results from `benchmarks.csv` via Streamlit.
- **Modular Codebase**:
  - `preprocessor.py`: Text extraction.
  - `memvid_interface.py`: MemVid wrapper.
  - `benchmark_utils.py`: Core benchmarking logic.
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: All metrics saved to `benchmarks.csv`.

## ‚ùì Key Research Questions

- How does MemVid‚Äôs storage compare to raw and gzipped text?
- What are encoding and decoding speeds across different sizes/codecs?
- Does retrieved text match the input exactly?
- How do codecs or Docker settings influence performance?

## üìä Project Summary & Preliminary Findings

This project, MemVid Evaluator, provides tools to empirically benchmark the MemVid library (v0.2.x) for its core text-to-video encoding and retrieval performance. We focus on storage efficiency, processing speed, and data transformation characteristics.
Key Initial Observations (using primarily mp4v codec, more tests ongoing):

**Storage:** MemVid's video/index storage for text is significantly larger (e.g., 18x-80x+) than original uncompressed text and substantially more so compared to gzipped text. The choice of tested video codec (mp4v, h265, h264) had a surprisingly minor impact on total storage size for successfully processed files.
Text Transformation: Input text processed by MemvidEncoder.add_text() (default chunking: 1024 char size, 32 char overlap) is transformed. The retrieved text (concatenation of chunks from MemvidRetriever) matches this internal "canonical" representation but differs in length and content from the original input string.

**Example Chart: Comparison of Actual Storage Sizes (mp4v codec)**

**Speed:** Encoding (~4s to 8+ minutes for <100KB to 1.5MB text) and decoding (~2s to 2+ minutes) times are non-trivial and scale with data size. Some specific encoder configurations (e.g., h265 without Docker for one large file) showed extreme processing times.

**Failures:** Some PDF/DOCX files consistently failed during encoding (index file not created).

**Conclusion (Preliminary):** While MemVid offers a novel approach, its current text encoding component shows considerable storage overhead and transforms input text. Its utility is likely best understood within its broader intended role as an AI memory system with RAG capabilities, rather than as a general-purpose, space-efficient, or perfectly fiducial text storage method.
This evaluator (run_all_experiments.py and the Streamlit app.py) allows users to replicate these tests and explore MemVid's performance with their own data and configurations.


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `pip`, `git`
- `libmagic1` (for `python-magic-bin`): 
  - Windows: usually pre-included
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install libmagic1`
  - macOS: `brew install libmagic`
- Optional for h265/h264 codecs:
  - FFmpeg in system PATH or
  - Docker (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/memvid-evaluator.git
cd memvid-evaluator
python -m venv venv
# Activate:
# macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (CMD): venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows (PowerShell): venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Automated Batch Testing

Edit `run_all_experiments.py` to select:
- `CODECS_TO_TEST` (e.g., `['mp4v', 'h265']`)
- `DOCKER_SETTINGS_TO_TEST` (e.g., `[False, True]`)

Run:
```bash
python run_all_experiments.py
```

Outputs:
- Progress printed to console.
- CSV saved to `data/results/`.
- Files saved to `data/memvid_output/`.

### 2. Interactive Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Upload file, select codec and Docker, run benchmark.
- Results saved to `benchmarks.csv` and displayed on UI.
- View dashboard from `üìä Results Dashboard` page.

## üìú Benchmark Output (benchmarks.csv)

- `original_text_size_bytes`, `gzipped_text_size_bytes`, `total_memvid_storage_bytes`
- `decoded_canonical_text_size_bytes`
- `encoding_time_seconds`, `decoding_full_time_seconds`
- `accuracy_check_input_vs_decoded_passed` (SHA256 match)
- `error_message` (if any)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Only evaluates `add_text()` and `Retriever` (not RAG/LLM).
- Accuracy impacted by MemVid's internal text processing.
- Hardware-dependent results.
- PDF/DOCX text extraction may vary.
